Hello! This is a Git Hub designed for hosting many files. I have uploaded my custom server, I hope you enjoy.
The server files can be found on the downloads page, it may take a while to download.
Please rename the file once downloaded. I am distributing other people's plugins to make it
easyer for you to run a simple bukkit server.


If you have any config questions, email me at mc.lordmeep@gmail.com

Thanks, Zack.
